I/ Requirements - What you need to install before
-------------------------------------------------

I.1 Common requirements
-----------------------

 - Python (3.1)
 - Blender 2.54+ build with Python 3.1 
 - git to get the code of the simulator:

You can get the code either from GitHub:
$ git clone https://github.com/laas/morse.git
or from the LAAS-CNRS main repo:
$ git clone http://trac.laas.fr/git/robots/morse.git

Note: The directory where you create the git clone will be refered to as
$MORSE_ROOT in this document.

If you plan to use the simulator with raw sockets of text files as "middleware",
you don't need anything else.

I.2 YARP
--------

For the YARP bindings
 - YARP version (2.2.5 or +) (version 2.3.0 is now to not work with MORSE)
 - YARP python binding
 - ACE ( 5.6.3 or +, required for YARP)

Instructions to create YARP-Python bindings are here:
http://eris.liralab.it/wiki/YARP_and_Python

To use camera with yarp < 2.3.2, you need to apply the patch stored in
patches/yarp.i.diff. 

Note that the easiest way to install YARP is probably to use robotpkg (see  
http://homepages.laas.fr/mallet/robotpkg for more instructions). You can 
install yarp and its dependancies using make install into devel/libpyyarp 
(set the option python3 for libpyyarp)

Compiling the YARP Python binding will create two files: yarp.py and _yarp.so
Copy them to the your Python lib directory (/usr/lib/python3.1/site-packages/)
or at some place reachable from your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

[NOTE FOR ROBOTPKG] You'll need to set the environnement variable PYTHONPATH to
${ROBOTPKG_BASE}/lib/python3.1/site-packages/ to let python finds the yarp
module.

I.2 Pocolibs
------------

To build Pocolibs bindings (the LAAS-CNRS middleware), you need to install
Pocolibs on your system.

The recommended way to do it is through robotpkg (see 
http://homepages.laas.fr/mallet/robotpkg for more informations).

To install:
$ cd $ROBOTPKG/devel/pocolibs 
$ make update

II/ Installation
----------------

From your MORSE root directory:
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make install

By default, MORSE will install in /usr/local. You can easily change that by 
launching ccmake instead of cmake. You can also set there if you want YARP and
Pocolibs bindings to be build. You can set up the different variables using
the command line : 
  - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX controls where will be installed MORSE
  - BUILD_POCOLIBS_SUPPORT controls the build of pocolibs support in MORSE
  - BUILD_YARP2_SUPPORT controls the build of YARP support in MORSE
  - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE controls the optimisation stuff for C/C++ extension
    (Release is a good choice).

To build and install MORSE with YARP support in /opt, you need something like:
$ cmake -DBUILD_YARP2_SUPPORT=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt ..


You can check your configuration is ok with:
$ morse check


III/ Running a simulation
-------------------------
 
[YARP specific] Before to start a simulation: Start the YARP's server
 with this command from a terminal "yarp server".

Launch MORSE by calling the morse executable:
$ morse

Several options are available, check them with:
$ morse help

Two environment variable have noticable effects:
 - $PYTHONPATH specifies the directories where MORSE scripts are located. It
   will start with the MORSE installation prefix, followed by the path to the
   python scripts. It must also include the full path to the directory
   'morse/blender' within the installed files. Example:

    tcsh:
    setenv PYTHONPATH ${morse_install_prefix}/lib/python3.1/site-packages:

    bash:
    export PYTHONPATH=${morse_install_prefix}/lib/python3.1/site-packages:

 - $MORSE_BLENDER that allows you to specify a custom Blender executable (else,
 Blender is looked for in the path).

To start a simulation, go on blender and press "P" to play the scenario.

Once launched, you can test the simulator by loading one of the example scenarii
from $MORSE_ROOT/share/examples/morse/scenarii (.blend files)

IV/ Testing
-----------

To test the external control clients, open the Blender file:
$MORSE_ROOT/share/examples/morse/scenarii/indoors_1/indoor_scene-2.0.blend
Start the simulation ('P')
Run the C program:
$MORSE_ROOT/share/examples/morse/clients/atrv/atrv_destination-1.0
Enter the coordinates where you want the robot to go. The robot will try to get
there.


Tips: If you have any problem to start to play a simulation: start blender
from a terminal and send us the error messages.
