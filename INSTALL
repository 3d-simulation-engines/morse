Requirements / What you need to install before :
 - Python (2.6 or +)	     
 - Blender 2.4.9 build with python 2.6 (For the moment the simulator work only with this version.)
 - YARP version (2.2.3 or +)
 - YARP python binding
 - ACE ( 5.6.3 or +, required for YARP)

 - bzr to get the code of the simulator

The easiest way to install it is probably to use robotpkg (see  
http://homepages.laas.fr/mallet/robotpkg for more instructions). You can install
yarp and its dependancies using make install into devel/libpyyarp.

You will probably need to set the environnement variable PYTHONPATH to 
${ROBOTPKG_BASE}/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/ to let python finds the yarp
module.

Download the source code of OpenRobots Simulator from this website:
For this, uses "bzr" and the following command: 
	$ bzr branch lp:~blender-for-robotics/openrobots-simulator/ors

Define the environment variable $ORS_ROOT by the path directory where you have
installed OpenRobots Simulator.

To test the simulator you can load some scenario from $ORS_ROOT/scenarii (.blend
files)

Before to start a simulation: Start the yarp's server with this command from a
terminal "yarp server".

To start a simulation, go on blender and press "P" to play the scenario.

Tips: If you have any problem to start to play a simulation: start blender
from a terminal and send us the error messages.
