===============================================================================

Requirements / What you need to install before
----------------------------------------------

 - Python (2.6 or +)	     
 - Blender 2.49 build with Python 2.6 [1]
 - git to get the code of the simulator

For the YARP bindings
 - YARP version (2.2.5 or +)
 - YARP python binding
 - ACE ( 5.6.3 or +, required for YARP)

The easiest way to install YARP is probably to use robotpkg (see  
http://homepages.laas.fr/mallet/robotpkg for more instructions). You can install
yarp and its dependancies using make install into devel/libpyyarp.

You'll need to set the environnement variable PYTHONPATH to 
${ROBOTPKG_BASE}/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ to let python finds the yarp
module.

Installation
------------

If not already done, download the source code of OpenRobots Simulator:
$ git clone http://trac.laas.fr/git/robots/morse.git


Set the environment variable $ORS_ROOT to the path directory where you have
installed OpenRobots Simulator.

To test the simulator you can load one of the example scenarii from
$ORS_ROOT/scenarii (.blend files)

[YARP specific] Before to start a simulation: Start the YARP's server
 with this command from a terminal "yarp server".

To start a simulation, go on blender and press "P" to play the scenario.

Tips: If you have any problem to start to play a simulation: start blender
from a terminal and send us the error messages.

[1] For the moment the simulator work only with this version. 
Blender 2.5 is being worked on.
