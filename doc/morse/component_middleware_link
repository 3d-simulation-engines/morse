Binding components with middlewares:

The dictionary in component_config.py (inside the Blender files) 
contain lists where the first item is the name of the middleware, and 
the following items are data needed by each middleware.

In the case of Yarp and Text, the second item will be the name of
the function to be added to the component's action list
For Pocolibs, the second item is the type of poster, and the third is
the name of the poster.

Example:

component_mw = {"Gyroscope": ["Yarp", "post_message"],
                "Motion_Controller": ["Yarp", "read_message"],
                "Motion_Controller.001": ["Pocolibs", "genPos", "p3dSpeedRef"],
                "CameraMain": ["Yarp", "post_image_RGBA"]}
