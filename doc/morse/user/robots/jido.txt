===== Adjustable parameters =====

The arm is rigged with an armature, following the mechanics of the arm. It is set to use Inverse Kinematics to follow an Empty object called **Target_Empty**. However, the IK solver is only available during execution of the simulation in Blender version 2.5 or higher. Thus, this remains as a future development.
