Stereo Camera unit
==================

This is not an independent sensor, but the combination of two :doc:`cameras
<camera>` and the :doc:`pan-tilt unit <pantilt>`. The cameras are already in
position and parented to the pan-tilt.  There is no associated Python file for
this component, only the Blender file.

Applicable modifiers
--------------------

The modifiers to the images should be done by configuring the individual
cameras attached to this component.
