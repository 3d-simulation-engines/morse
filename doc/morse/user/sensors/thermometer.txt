====== Thermometer sensor ======

This sensor emulates a Thermometer, measuring the temperature with respect to the distance to hear sources.
It defines a default temperature throughout the scenario, which is affected by local fire sources. The temperature rises exponentially when the distance between the sensor and the heat source decreases.
Temperature is given in degrees Celcius.
