====== Video camera sensor ======

This sensor emulates a single video camera. It generates a series of RGBA images. Images are ecoded as binary char arrays, with 4 bytes per pixel.

The cameras make use of Blender's **VideoTexture** module, which requires a graphic card capable of GLSL shading. Also, the 3D view window in Blender must be set to draw **Textured** objects. 

===== Configurable parameters =====

The Empty object corresponding to this sensor has the following parameters:
	* **capturing**: (boolean) flat that determines whether the camera should generate an image. It can be toggled on or off by pressing the 'Spacebar'
	* **cam_width**: (double) generated image width in pixels
	* **cam_height**: (double) generated image height in pixels
	* **cam_focal**: (double) camera focal length measured in milimeters
