====== Pan-tilt unit ======

The purpose of this component is to link together one or more cameras, and provide them with the posibility to move together as a single unit.
It will also provide the connection interface to use the information of the cameras attached to it. In the case of two cameras, it will provide the stereo information generated from the two camera images.

__Note__: The movement of the pan-tilt unit is not yet implemented, but will be a future development.
