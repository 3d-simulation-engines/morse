====== Getting started: a first example of MORSE usage ======


===== Basic Blender commands =====

Selection of an object: RMB over the object

Geometric transformations of an object: Press the corresponding key, then move 
with the mouse. Press LMB to accept transformation, or RMB to cancel. Hold 
<key>C</key> key while transforming, to use discrete intervals. The shortcut 
keys are <key>G</key> for translation, <key>S</key> for scaling and <key>R</key>
 for rotation.

Camera view shortcuts: Use the numeric keyboard
  * Top view: <key>7</key>
  * Front view: <key>1</key>
  * Side view: <key>3</key>
  * Main camera view: <key>0</key>
  * Toggle perspective/orthogonal view: <key>5</key>

Switch shading modes:
  * Wireframe/solid: <key>Z</key>
  * Wireframe/solid: <key>S-Z</key>
  * Solid/textured: <key>A-Z</key>


===== Creation of scenario files =====

Using the ''morse'' binary program, to open or create new simulation scenarios:

  $ morse  % Will create a new copy of the basic scenario file, ready to be modified

  $ morse [Filename]  % The MORSE simulator is started using the indicated files.

  $ morse create [Filename]  % It will create a new file with the name given, and ready to be edited.

===== Adding components to files =====

  * Open file
  * Link elements (robots, scenarios sensors) <key>S-F1</key>
  * Select the source Blender file, and then Objects
  * Select the objects to insert, using the RMB
  * Select the **Link** and **Relative Paths** toggle buttons
  * Click **Load Library**
  * The objects will be inserted in the scene, at the origin, and with a cyan 
selection highlight
  * Select the parent object, then press <key>S-G</key>, then select **Children** 
or press <key>enter</key>
  * Press the <key>L</key> key, then select **Selected Objects** or press 
<key>enter</key>
  * The object will now have a pink selection highlight, and can be 
moved/rotated/scaled

===== Parenting components to a robot =====

  * Select the Empty object of the component, then hold <key>S</key> and select the robot
  * Press <key>C-P</key>, then select **Make parent** or press <key>enter</key>


====== Start and stop a simulation =====

To start the simulation, press the <key>P</key> key.
To stop, press the <key>esc</key> key. Under certain error conditions ESC may 
not work, in that case, an emergency exit key is <key>F12</key>, wich will try 
to exit without doing executing the cleanup functions. If this doesn't work, the
 command <key>C-\</key> on the terminal will kill Blender.
