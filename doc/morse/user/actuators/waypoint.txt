====== Waypoint target movement ======

This actuator reads the coordinates of a destination point, and moves the robot towards the given point, with the robot restricted to moving only forward, backwards or turning over its Z axis.
This controller is meant to be used mainly by non-holonomic robots.
The speeds provided are internally adjusted to the Blender time measure.

==== Local data =====
  * **x**: Destination X coordinate
  * **Y**: Destination Y coordinate
  * **Z**: Destination Z coordinate
  * **speed**: Movement speed

__Note__: Coordinates are given with respect to the origin of Blender's coordinate axis.

===== Applicable modifiers =====

  * UTM modifier: Will add an offset to the Blender coordinates according to the parameters set on the scene.

  * NED: Changes the coordinate reference to use North (X), East (Y), Down (Z)
