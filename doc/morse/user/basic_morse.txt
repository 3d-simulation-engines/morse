====== Getting started: basic MORSE usage ======


===== Basic Blender commands =====

==== Selection of an object ====
:RMB: over the object

==== Geometric transformations of an object ====

=== Keyborad input ===

To enter with the keyboard accurate transformation value, press <key>N</key>.

=== With the mouse ===
The shortcut keys are <key>g</key> for translation, <key>s</key> for scaling and
 <key>r</key> for rotation.
 
Press the desired key, then move with the mouse.

Press :LMB: to accept transformation, or :RMB: to cancel.

Tips:
  * Hold <key>C</key> key while transforming, to use discrete intervals. 
  * Press <key>X</key>, <key>Y</key> or <key>Z</key> to constraint the transformation on one axis.

==== Camera view shortcuts ====
Use the numeric keyboard
  * Top view: <key>'7 NumPad'</key>
  * Front view: <key>'1 NumPad'</key>
  * Side view: <key>'3 NumPad'</key>
  * Main camera view: <key>'0 NumPad'</key>
  * Toggle perspective/orthogonal view: <key>'5 NumPad'</key>

==== Switch shading modes ====
  * Wireframe/solid: <key>z</key>
  * Wireframe/solid: <key>S-z</key>
  * Solid/textured: <key>A-z</key>

==== Opening and saving files ====
  * Open file: <key>F1</key>
  * Save file: <key>C-w</key>
  * Save file as... : <key>F2</key>
  * Quit Blender: <key>C-q</key>

==== Button pannels ====
Selection of the type of pannel in the Buttons Window:
  * Logic buttons: <key>F4</key>
  * Material buttons: <key>F5</key>
  * Texture buttons: <key>F6</key>
  * Object buttons: <key>F7</key>
  * Editting buttons: <key>F9</key>

===== Creation of scenario files =====

Use the ''morse'' binary program, to open or create new simulation scenarios:

  $ morse

Will create a new copy of the basic scenario file, ready to be modified.

  $ morse create [Filename]

It will create a new file with the name given, and ready to be edited.

  $ morse [Filename]

The MORSE simulator is started using an existing file with the name specified.

===== Adding components to files =====

  * Open file
  * Link elements (robots, scenarios sensors) <key>S-F1</key>
  * Select the source Blender file, and then Objects
  * Select the objects to insert, using the :RMB:
  * Select the **Link** and **Relative Paths** toggle buttons
  * Click **Load Library**
  * The objects will be inserted in the scene, at the origin, and with a cyan selection highlight
  * Select the parent object, then press <key>S-g</key>, then select **Children** or press <key>enter</key>
  * Press the <key>l</key> key, then select **Selected Objects** or press <key>enter</key>
  * The object will now have a pink selection highlight, and can be moved/rotated/scaled

===== Parenting components to a robot =====

  * Select the Empty object of the component, then hold <key>S</key> and select the robot
  * Press <key>C-p</key>, then select **Make parent** or press <key>enter</key>


===== Start and stop a simulation =====

To start the simulation, press the <key>p</key> key.

To stop, press the <key>esc</key> key.

/!\ Under certain error conditions ESC may not work, in that case, an emergency exit
key is <key>F12</key>, wich will try to exit without doing executing the 
cleanup functions. If this doesn't work, the command <key>C-\</key> on the 
terminal will kill Blender.
