==== Setting up a YARP-based simulation ====
- Usage example with Yarp. Simple dummy autonomous navigation towards a user-given target (x,y). The robots becomes red when it intersects obstacles or bounces on them. Use the same example as the quickstart ? (sole difference: the goal is given through yarp, sensor data are exported with yarp -- maybe adda a camera, since it is trivial to displa an image with yarp).
