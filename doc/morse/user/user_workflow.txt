====== The MORSE user workflow ======

The general steps to follow to do a simulation in MORSE are the following:

  * Create the robot configuration that matches the real robot
  * Create a scenario file, based on the default MORSE file
    $ morse create [file_name]
  * Link in the robot
  * Link in any aditional robots/sensors/actuators
  * Link in the middleware and modifier objects
  * Configure the components to use specific modifiers and middlewares
  * Save the new scene
  * Prepare the middleware environments (in the case of YARP or Pocolibs)
  * Start the simulation
  * Look at the terminal window to check that everything started correctly
  * Start the client programs that will connect with the simulator
  * Finish the simulation by pressing <key>esc</key>
  * Quit Blender by pressing <key>C-q</key> and <key>enter</key>
