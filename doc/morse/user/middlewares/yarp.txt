====== YARP ======
The YARP middleware provides a simple method to share data across components in different computers. It is based on the concept of //ports//, which are registered in a //name server// to differentiate between separate channels of communication.
Data is shared in the format of bottles, which are nested data structures of various data types.

__Note__: Port names used in MORSE have the following format: ''/ors/robots/[robot_name]/[component_name]/[direction]''. The term [direction] is either ''in'' or ''out'', depending on the type of component being actuator or sensor, respectively.

===== Available methods =====

  * ''read_message'': Gets information from a port, and stores it in the ''modified_data'' array of the associated component. This method is only able to handle data of types: integer, float and string.
  * ''post_message'': Formats the contents of ''modified_data'' into a bottle, and sends it through the port associated with a component. This method is only able to handle data of types: integer, float and string.
  * ''post_image_RGBA'': (Requires YARP version 2.5+) Sends an image through a specialised port. The image must be stored in ''modified_data'' as a binary string with 32bit pixels encoded as RGBA. The actual size of the image is read directly from the component instance that called this method.
