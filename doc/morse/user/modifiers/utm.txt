====== UTM conversion ======
This modifier converts the coordinates generated by the MORSE simulator to use UTM global coordinates. This is achieved by setting the offset of the Blender origin with respect to the UTM reference. The offset is stored as three properties of the ''Scene_Script_Holder'' object of the scene: ''UTMXOffset'', ''UTMYOffset'' and ''UTMZOffset''.

  * Blender: ''$ORS_ROOT/data/morse/components/modifiers/utm_empty.blend''
  * Python: ''$ORS_ROOT/src/morse/modifiers/utm_mod.py''

==== Modified data =====
Modifiers work over an array called ''modified_data'' of the components.
The indices of the variables affected are the following:
  * **0**: X coordinate of the component
  * **1**: Y coordinate of the component
  * **2**: Z coordinate of the component

For example, changing the X coordiante is done by altering the value of ''modified_data[0]''.

===== Available methods =====

  * ''blender_to_utm'': Used for the [[morse:user:sensors:gps | GPS sensor]]
  * ''utm_to_blender'': Used for the [[morse:user:actuators:destination | Straight]] and [[morse:user:actuators:waypoint | Waypoint]] actuators
