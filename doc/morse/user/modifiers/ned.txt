====== NED conversion ======
This modifier converts the coordinates generated by the MORSE simulator to change to the North, East, Down (NED) coordinate system, instead of the East, North, Up (ENU) system normally used by Blender.
This is achieved by switching the direction of the X and Y axis, as well as inverting the sense of the Z axis.

===== Files =====
Blender: ''$ORS_ROOT/data/morse/components/modifiers/ned_empty.blend''
Python: ''$ORS_ROOT/src/morse/modifiers/ned_mod.py''

=== Modified data =====
Modifiers work over an array called ''modified_data'' of the components.
The indices of the variables affected are the following:
  * **0**: X coordinate of the component
  * **1**: Y coordinate of the component
  * **2**: Z coordinate of the component

For example, changing the X coordiante is done by altering the value of ''modified_data[0]''.

===== Available methods =====

  * ''blender_to_ned'': Used for the [[morse:user:sensors:gps | GPS sensor]]
  * ''ned_to_blender'': Used for the [[morse:user:actuators:destination | Straight]] and [[morse:user:actuators:waypoint | Waypoint]] actuators
