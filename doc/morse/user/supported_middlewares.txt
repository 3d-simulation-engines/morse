====== Middleware Support ======

Middlewares provide a means for the simulated data to be shared with external programs. MORSE is designed to be middleware independent, so that its internal functioning is not tied no any one particular middleware, but it is capable of communicating with any type of architecture.

===== Current list of compatible middlewares =====

  * [[morse:user:middlewares:text | Text file output]]
  * [[morse:user:middlewares:socket | Sockets]]
  * [[morse:user:middlewares:yarp | YARP]]
  * [[morse:user:middlewares:pocolibs | Pocolibs]]

===== Linking a middleware in a scene =====

To be able to use a middleware inside of a scene, it is necessary to link the Empty object from the corresponding Blender file. This process is explained in the [[tutorial | basic tutorial]]. Also there is an explanation on how to configure the components to call middleware functions.

===== Expanding the middlewares =====

New middlewares can be added to MORSE by following these [[morse:user:middlewares:new_middleware | instructions]].
