====== Middleware Support ======

Middlewares provide a means for the simulated data to be shared with external programs. MORSE is designed to be middleware independent, so that its internal functioning is not tied no any one particular middleware, but it is capable of communicating with any type of architecture.

===== Current list of compatible middlewares =====

  * [[morse:user:middlewares:text | Text file output]]
  * [[morse:user:middlewares:socket | Sockets]]
  * [[morse:user:middlewares:yarp | YARP]]
  * [[morse:user:middlewares:pocolibs | Pocolibs]]

===== Expanding the middlewares =====

New middlewares can be added to MORSE by following these [[morse:user:middlewares:new_middleware | instructions]]. There is also an explanation of the "[[morse:user:middlewares:hooks | hooks]]" connectivity used to share data between components and middlewares.
