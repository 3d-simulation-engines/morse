=========================
 TARGETS FOR RELEASE 0.3
=========================

Middlewares
-----------

- Requests: ensure some working control of the simulation
  based on the socket interface (restart, pause,...)
- ROS support for the robot's joint state and camera

Simulation supervision
----------------------

- Add an option the replace all objects at their initial position without relaunching the simulation

=========================
 TARGETS FOR RELEASE 0.4
=========================

Middlewares
-----------

- add support for services through the YARP, ROS and Pocolibs middleware

Architecture
------------

- make clear how components access other components? (eg: the cameras need the
  position of the robot)

Simulation supervision
----------------------

- Introduce a mean to externally control time, by pacing the game engine time
  (e.g. through a socket, cf mail from Benoit Bolsee on Jan. the 10th in
  blender-robotics)

- Multi-engine distributed simulation: define the procotol that allows to
  dispatch various robots on several machines running blender, while maintaining
  the world state consistent within these machines.

- Introduce means to define scenarios with controlled dynamic events (through
  requests?) 

GUI
---

- Define a user interface to specify a scenario

- Split the .blend file into scene / robot files

Components
----------

- Motion capture poster: MORSE should be able to simulate a motion capture setup
by allowing the designer to paste markers in the scene whose position will be
exported

- "Point Cloud" sensors: generate 3D depth images to simulate either
stereovision at an abstract level or various Lidars. Make it generic: export
depth data (openGL z-buffer?), define mofifiers that sample the data according
to a given sensor geometry.


================
 OTHERS and MISC
================

Coding style
------------

- Replace all "print" by the Python logging interface
- every simple function must have a function comment ( """ ... """) + setup the
  documentation to be generated
- Change the names of modules, variables, classes, etc. to comply with the
  naming conventions in: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Frame transformations
---------------------

- Representation of all the frames defined within a robot (one frame per sensor,
  one robot frame). 
- Geo-referenced frames for initial geographic data (define and store a frame
  transformation between the Blender reference frame and an abosolute
  geo-reference frame)
- Camera geometry: associate a projection matrix to each camera
- Respect the usual standards (e.g. for cameras), define and document the other
  choices

Code organisation
-----------------
- One repo for scenarii (morse-scenarii.git)

User-interface
--------------
- Graphic tree of logic components and their interaction (no meshes, ... )

Architecture
------------
- unified time management ("what if we want to simulate at 2X?")

Simulated component
-------------------
- Simulation of wireless communication between robots: delay, lost of connection, noise...

Linking issues
--------------
- when properties are added in linked components (eg, cameras),
the new properties don't show up in the scene that import these components.

- A lot of room for improvement regarding the general process of linking a robot
component into a scene. Issue with making stuff 'local', lacking a good GUI, when
opening a .blend file, it's not clear what should be imported...

Other stuff 
-----------
- find a way to limit the framerate of the simulation, without lowering the physics clock (only the display).
  This would allow to free CPU for other application while the simulator is running.
- commit policy
- Standardize the scale of objects in MORSE. The 'Grande Salle' scene looks way smaller than the robots


Rosace Project
--------------
- Add timeline of events in the simulation
- Add init script that places the robots and victims specified in a XML file
