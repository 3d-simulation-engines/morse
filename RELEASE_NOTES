MORSE v 0.2
-----------

- Components have "hooks" to export their data. Middleware lives in parallel
threads and "visit" the components. In this case, middlewares still lives
in the Python VM. Advantage: better decoupling ; middleware can dynamically
choose what they want to watch.

- Add serialize methods to the data of each component. This will format the 
data according to the needs of each middleware/architecture.

- Possibility to control the camera when the game engine runs (with keyboard, 
mouse, or attach some view to some robots)
