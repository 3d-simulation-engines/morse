MORSE v 0.2a1
=============

General changes
---------------

- Switch to Blender 2.5: MORSE now officialy supports Blender 2.5x (x>=4) and 
the support for Blender 2.49 has been dropped.

- This means that MORSE is now fully Python 3 compatible. New code must be from
now valid Python 3 code.

New features
------------

- Much work went on the support of humans in the simulator. A fully rigged human
model is now available. It can be controlled in a "first person shooter"-like
mode, enabling immersive simulation of human-robot interaction.

- Support for the PA-10 and Kuka arms. They can be controlled either by specifying
a target that the arm tries to reach (using Blender ITASC IK solver) or by
sending a set of joint angles.

- new simple waypoint controller: this 'high-level' controller allows to give 
only a list of waypoint to the robot. The simulator takes care of the navigation 
(currently, simple straight lines, without any sort of obstacle avoidance)

- "Semantic camera" sensor: MORSE can export position, orientation and name 
of specifically marked objects that are in a camera field of view.

- we now have a fully simulated SICK laser sensor.

- Possibility to control the camera when the game engine runs (with keyboard, 
mouse, or attach some view to some robots)

Architectural changes
---------------------

- Components have "hooks" to export their data. Middleware lives in parallel
threads and "visit" the components. In this case, middlewares still lives
in the Python VM. Advantage: better decoupling ; middleware can dynamically
choose what they want to watch.

- Add 'serialize' methods to the data of each component. This formats the 
data according to the needs of each middleware/architecture.
